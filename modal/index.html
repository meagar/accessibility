    <h1>Accessible Modal Dialogs from Scratch</h1>

    <p>This document demonstrates a working modal dialog developed with no external dependencies. It includes the minimal amount of HTML, JavaScript and CSS to power the modal, and nothing else.</p>

    <p>You can spawn the modal by clicking the following link, which <b>simulates</b> a prompt to close the current document (regardless of how you respond to the modal, the document will not closed).</p>

    <p><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="show">Close Window (spawn modal)</a></p>

    <h2>Features Include...</h2>

    <ul>
    <li>Upon opening the modal, focus should move to the "cancel" button - the safest button for a user to accidentially click.</li>
    <li>Upon closing the modal, focus should return to the "Close Window" link above.</li>
    <li>While the modal is open, focus is trapped and cannot return to the main document. The main content is also hidden with <code>aria-hidden="true"</code>, while the document itself has <code>aria-hidden="false"</code> and <code>aria-modal="true"</code> applied to it.</li>
    <li>The modal is decorated with <code>role="alertdialog"</code> which triggers a system-level alert</li>
    <li>The modal is described by a hidden element containing a more detailed explanation than the text that appears for sighted users. When the modal appears, the screenreader should announce:
      <blockquote>"You are in a modal window prompting you to abandon your unsaved changes. You may click "ok" to abandon your chagnes or "cancel" to return tot he parent document."</blockquote>
    </li>
    <li>The modal can be dismissed with the Escape key, or by clicking the backdrop</li>
    </ul>
