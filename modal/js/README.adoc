== Objective

This document outlines how to produce modals dialogs that follow best practices for usability and accessibility for all users, not just persons with impairment.

The focus is on implementation, and the intended audience is technical, primarily developers working in front-end technologies.

== Dialogs and Modals

Dialogs are popup windows that appear over other content.
They’re commonly seen in traditional desktop software, but somewhat rare on the Internet.
Modal dialogs (or “modals”) are dialogs that appear and block the content behind them, forcing the user to focus on the dialog until it is somehow “resolved”.
_Modal_ dialogs are extremely common on the Internet, and there are thousands of libraries for producing them.
This document will build an accessible best-practices modal “from scratch”, with no external dependencies.
The lessons learned should be useful in assessing new and existing modals at, and vetting potential libraries for managing modals.

It’s very easy to produce something that appears to be a modal dialog.
From a development standpoint, this typically involves obscuring the document via a backdrop `<div>` with a semi-transparent background, and centring a modal `<div>`` over top of the backdrop.
While this dialog may be _visually_ modal, it may not be modal from a functional or accessible perspective.
Dialogs can miss any number of expected user behaviors or necessary accessibility features, and the results range from an inconsistent and frustrating UX to a website that is unusable by people relying on assistive technology.

Some key parts of modal dialogs that are often overlooked:

* Keyboard navigation in the browser does not work well with modals unless specific care is taken to make it work.
    This involves sending focus into the modal and trapping it there, and returning it to the parent document when the modal closes.

 * Modal UX should adhere to best practices in order to meet user expectations.
    This includes dismissing the modal with the Escape key, or by clicking the backdrop.

* Screen readers typically have no idea that modal content is modal content.
    Something that appears visually “front-and-center” and impossible to ignore can actually be invisible to a user depending on assistive technology.
    Additional DOM markup (ie role, aria-hidden and aria-modal) can help assistive technology understand your document as new content is added or revealed, and attributes like aria-labelledby and aria-describedby can provide vital context for users with visual impairment.

== Properties of an Accessible Modal

An accessible modal should have all of the following properties, typically absent from the simplest modal dialog implementations:

* It has `role=”alertdialog”` (for modals) or `role=”alert”` (for non-modals)

* It descends from `<body>`` outside of the main content tree.
    For example, if your content is wrapped in a `<div role=”main” class=”container”>`, the modal’s tree should be a sibling of that div, not descend from it. 

* Provide extra descriptive text for visually impaired users who cannot rely on visual queues that a modal is present, and tied to the modal via `aria-describedby`

* `aria-modal` is set to `true` when the modal is shown, and false when the modal is hidden.
    Additionally, non-modal content receives `aria-hidden=”true”` while the modal is visible, but neither the modal of any ancestor may have `aria-hidden=”true”` applied.

* It must contain at least one clickable element, and focus should move to the first clickable element when the modal is spawned.
    Focus should return to the element that spawned the modal when the modal is dismissed.
    If the modal contains several options, the safest option should be focused by default, so that accidentally clicking a button (ie, by double-pressing the spacebar) performs the safest action.
    For example, a modal that prompts the user “Abandon unsaved changes? Yes/No” should default to “No” so accidental clicks are as non-destructive as possible.

* It traps focus within itself, as long as the modal is visible (it’s impossible via keyboard navigation to “tab” off of the modal, back to elements behind it)

== Building an Accessible Modal

In this section we’ll walk over the critical elements required to build an accessible modal in HTML and JavaScript.
Most of the inessential styling is hidden. For a complete example, skip to 
Baseline Markup and CSS

Markup for modal dialogs typically involves two main components:

* A backdrop or overlay which sits behind the modal, and partially obscures the main content

* A modal container that holds the modal itself

Sample markup might appear as follows:

.Basic HTML for a document containing a modal dialog
[source, html]
----
<body>
  <div class="main-content">
    <!-- Main document content appears here -->
  </div>
  <div class="modal-overlay">
    <div class="modal-content">
      <!-- Modal content appears here and does not descend from `main-content` -->
    </div>
  </div>
</body>
----

Takeaway 1: The main content and modal content should be siblings; the modal content should not appear as a descendant of the main content element

Showing the Modal

When shown, there are several changes that need to happen within the DOM:
Modal Visibility

    The modal content tree should have its visibility set to visible. This can be accomplished by manipulating the elements style attribute directly in JavaScript, or by toggling a class on the modal element. Bootstrap often uses in for this purpose

/* Default - hidden */
.modal-overlay {
  visibility: hidden;
}

/* Styles applied when modal is visibile */
.modal-overlay.in {
visibility: visible;
}

The modal element itself must have role=”dialog” attribute applied to it:

    document.querySelector('.modal-content')

Main content visibility

    The main content tree should have the aria-hidden=”true” attribute applied to it. This prevents keyboard focus from moving back to this portion of the document, and it prevents screen readers from reading any of its content. Visually, the modal overlay will obscure this content for sighted users so their attention is drawn to the modal; aria-hidden effectively accomplishes the same for visually impaired users.

document.querySelector('.main-content').setAttribute('aria-hidden', 'true');
